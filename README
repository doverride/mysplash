Splash (A striking show of impression) SELinux security policy

RATIONALE

Splash aims to be compelling sample SELinux security policy to be used as a basis to build upon.

Security, and security policy is no "one-size-fits-all". SELinux security policy is no different. Splash appreciates
that and aims to provide an optimal common basis. Splash tries to strike a delicate balance, and aims
to "work out of the box" but may require tailoring, especially on systems with exotic configurations.

Splash aims to be as modular as reasonably possible, and provides only a minimal set of "building blocks". Splash tries
not to base decisions on assumption, and as a result provides little to no security by itself. You are in charge! 

Splash is written in SELinux Common Intermediate Language to provide optimal flexibility and performance while leaving
a relatively small foot print, catering to embedded requirements.

Splash is inspired by NSA Example Policy[1], as well as Tresys Reference Policy[2].

MINIMAL REQUIREMENTS

Compilation requires the SELinux Common Intermediate Language (CIL) Compiler[3]

The load_policy, setfiles, and setenforce utilities provided with policycoreutils by the SELinux Project[4] are
required to load Splash policy, set file contexts and modes respectively[5]

INSTALLATION

1. Install the SELinux CIL compiler in "/usr/bin/"
2. Clone the Splash GIT repository[6] in "/etc/selinux"
3. Create "/etc/selinux/config" file with the following:
        SELINUX=enforcing
        SELINUXTYPE=splash
4. Change directory to /etc/selinux/splash
5. Execute "splash.sh"
6. Execute "setenforce 0" to change SELinux mode to permissive
7. Execute "load_policy" to load Splash
8. Execute "restorecon -R -v -F /" to reset file contexts
9. Reboot

NOTES

Splash only supports Linux objects and the Linux object manager. Many modern distributions depend on
additional user space object managers some of which can be disabled on runtime, and some of which depend on one
or more configuration files being present in "/etc/selinux/splash/contexts"

Splash only supports the minimal required Identity-Based Access Control, Role-Based Access Control, and
Type Enforcement SELinux security models but can easily be customized to support optional User-Based Access Control,
Multi-Category, and Multi-Level Security models.
